# This file lists all the Python packages that this project depends on.
# Installing these dependencies into a virtual environment is a critical first step
# to ensure the application runs correctly without "ModuleNotFoundError" runtime errors.
# Pinning versions (e.g., streamlit==1.33.0) guarantees that the app is tested
# with and runs on specific, stable versions of each library, preventing
# unexpected issues from future package updates.
